# Appwrite Database query converter
With the Appwrite query syntax undergoing a change, we thought of adding a converter that will help API developers convert the old syntax to JSON and pass it to the API. 
For more information about the change in syntax, refer to this [discussion](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/discussions/7197).

Try the Query converter [here](https://dbconverter.vercel.app/).
